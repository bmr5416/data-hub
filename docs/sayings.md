1. THE OBVIOUS TIP

"To survive a client call, keep your 'I told you so' count above 0 while lowering theirs to 0. This is considered strategy."


2. THE ATTRIBUTION LORE

The ancient art of Multi-Touch Attribution has been debated by scholars for generations. Each platform claims sole credit for the conversion. None can be trusted. All demand more budget.


3. THE PRACTICAL ADVICE

If you start a scope creep you can't finish, try adding it to the next SOW. Your client just might forget they asked for it...


4. THE FACTION WARNING

"Media Buyers are naturally armored throughout their body... with the exception of the ego. Try using QBR data to target this area, and defeat them before they get close enough to request more spend."

"The best attribution models are passed on by the survivors." — Unknown Analyst, sometime before the iOS 14 apocalypse

8. THE SETTLEMENT DESCRIPTION

The Agency floor lacks a unified government, and any institutional system of PTO approval. If you wrong a Project Manager, prepare to be CC'd on everything for eternity.


9. THE PROPAGANDA TIP

Want to prevent a client from fleeing? Cripple their expectations early. A realistic forecast in Q1 will save your Q4.


10. THE HISTORICAL NOTE
